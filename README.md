- 👋 Hi, I’m @AJBry
- 👀 I’m interested in skateboarding, games and anime.
- 🌱 I’m currently going to school for Computer Science believe it or not.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some games as I've learned over this past semester how to work together with a group and I have previous experience with languages such as:
- Python, Java, C++, and somewhat Verilog
- I don't have much under my belt but I am looking to change that over the summer.
- 📫 How to reach me /I'll fix this later/
